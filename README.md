## Problem Statement
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is one of the major public health diseases in the world which is progressively increasing day by day and had its effect on many countries. Thus, it is very important to predict it at an early age which has been a challenging task among researchers because the symptoms of disease come into existence in either middle or late middle age. So this project focuses on using various machine learning techniques such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, Decision Tree and KNeighbors algorithms. The prediction efficiency would be beneficial for patients who are suffering from Parkinson. Generally in the first stage, Parkinson can be cured by the proper treatment. So it‘s important to identify the PD at the early stage for the betterment of the patients. The main purpose of this work is to find the best prediction model.
